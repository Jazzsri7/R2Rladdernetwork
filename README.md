# A Glance at R-2R ladder network
This paper presents a design and implementation of a high-performance R-2R ladder digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using an operational amplifier (Op-Amp). The R-2R ladder network, comprising resistors with values of R and 2R, provides a simple and cost-effective solution for converting digital signals into analog voltages. The Op-Amp, with its high gain and low output impedance, amplifies the output of the R-2R ladder, improving the overall accuracy and resolution of the DAC. The proposed design focuses on minimizing errors caused by resistor tolerances, parasitic capacitances, and Op-Amp limitations.
